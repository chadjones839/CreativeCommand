# Creative Command

Creative Command is built for the advertising professional that's constantly on the the move, juggling numerous daily responsibilities. The development of an ad campaign can take a few days to a few weeks, and can change multiple hands (from sales, production, traffic, etc). This platform is a lite CRM with a heavy focus on tracking campaigns in each stage of their process.

The tech stack for this project includes SQL, C#, and .NET on the backend and JavaScript/React on the front. Firebase was used for password authentication.

## Usage

- Click 'Register' and create a new user from the home page to login.
- Click 'Add Account' to create a new account. 
- Once a new account is created, a user can add campaigns to that account. Either from the home page or the account page, click the "Create Campaign" button.
- After a campaign is created, the user is brought to the campaign details page. This contains infomation on the campaign, as well as a new tracker bar.
- To edit the tracker, click "update campaign". The user is presented with a series of dropdowns. The dropdowns can only be completed in order.
